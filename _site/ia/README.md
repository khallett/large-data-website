# Australia's DEADLIEST Animals!

Australia is home to gorgeous beaches, gorgeous people, and gorgeous wine. What travellers don't often think about are the more dangerous predators that inhabit the land down under. 

## Purpose

This project is a school project to learn about making design systems for large-scale websites.

Iâ€™m super stoked to learn about using Git and GitHub in a classroom setting.

## Why Australia's DEADLIEST Animals?!

I recently took up an interest in travelling down under after making friends on my trip to Europe, who live all over the gorgeous country. I figured why not combine my research for travel and interest in animals in one go!

I am a nice shark, not a *mindless, eating machine*. If I am to change this image I must first change myself. Fish are friends, not food. Hello, my name is Bruce.
